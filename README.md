1. Project Overview
This capstone project focuses on developing a simple full-stack web application for Community Events Hub, aimed at helping users discover and post local events like yard sales, meetups, and community classes. The app will support public users and event creators by offering a basic interface for sharing events in a centralized place.
The project will include:
A public event listing board
A form for adding new events
Basic search or filtering by category or date
Backend services to support event CRUD operations and basic user authentication.
This project will use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), helping the learner practice CRUD, authentication, and form handling in a simplified app.
